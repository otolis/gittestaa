    <h1>Method</h1>
    <h4>STEP 1</h4>
    <p>
        Put a large <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/five-best-saucepans"> saucepan </a> of water to boil

    </p>
    <h4>STEP 2</h4>
    <p>
        Finely <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/top-five-cooks-knives"> chop</a> the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 3</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/best-whisks"> Beat</a> the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 4</h4>
    <p>
        Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 5</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/review/top-five-garlic-gadgets"> Squash</a> 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just bruise it
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 6</h4>
    <p>
        While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 7</h4>
    <p>
        Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
    </p>
    <h4>STEP 8</h4>
    Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
    <h4>STEP 9</h4>
    Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
    <h4>STEP 10</h4>
    Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
    <h4>STEP 11</h4>
    Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
    <h4>STEP 12</h4>
    Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
    <h4>RECIPE TIPS-THE MAGIC INGREDIENT</h4>
    <p>
        Pasta water can be dripped in as you transfer the spaghetti to the hot frying pan. Everything mingles to make a light, silky smooth sauce.
